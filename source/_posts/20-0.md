|摘要|In order to solve parameters selection problem when applying recursive least square (RLS),least mean square (LMS) normalized or LMS (NLMS) algorithms to estimate kernels of second-order Volterra filter (SOVF), a novel adaptive gbest-guide artificial bee colony (AGABC) optimization algorithm is used to derive kernels of Volterra, that is a type of the AGABC-SOVF prediction model with an explicit configuration for speech signal is proposed. The AGABC algorithm modifies the solution search equation of ABC algorithm and combines the best solution with neighborhood information at present iteration, which not only ensures the exploration of the global optimization algorithm but also improves the exploitation. The AGABC-SOVF model is performed to predict speech signal series of the given English phonemes, sentences, and chaotic time series. Simulation results based on benchmark function show that AGABC algorithm performs faster convergence in achieving higher quality solutions than original ABC and other improved ABC algorithms. Prediction results of applying the AGABC-SOVF model to multi-step predictions for Lorenz time series reveal its stability and convergence properties. For the measured multi-frame speech signals, prediction accuracy and length of multi-step prediction using the AGABC-SOVF model are better than that of the ABC-SOVF model. The AGABC-SOVF model can better predict chaotic time series and the real measured speech signal series.|

|摘要|As an important part of brain-computer interface (BCI), the electroencephalog-raphy (EEG) technology of motor imagery (MI) has been gradually recognizedfor its great theoretical value and practical application. In this study, in view ofthe different MI tasks corresponding to active region of the EEG signals, weadopt a two-dimensional form including time, frequency, and electrode locationinformation, then we design a classification method containing continuoussmall convolutional neural network (CSCNN). This method is mainly used forfeature extraction through continuous small convolutional kernels and one rect-angle convolutional kernel, and the softmax classifier for classification. In theexperiment, classification accuracy and kappa value are used as evaluationcriteria to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this study. For clas-sification accuracy, BCI competition IV data set 2b is used to compare with theother five classification methods (CNN, CNN-SAE, stacked autoencoder [SAE],support vector machine [SVM], and one-dimensional convolution combinedwith gated recurrent unit [1DCGRU]). The results demonstrate that the overallaccuracy of CSCNN is higher than other methods, and CSCNN obtains an aver-age accuracy of 82.8%. For kappa value, BCI competition IV data set 2b is usedto compare with the other three methods (filter bank common spatial pattern[FBCSP], Twin SVM, and CNN-SAE). The performance of CSCNN is better withan average value of 0.663. Overall, the results show that CSCNN maintains asmall number of parameters and improves the classification accuracy.|
